# 1. Use a stable base image with Python 3.11 (not 3.13, to avoid package build issues)
FROM python:3.11-slim

# 2. Install system packages required for building Python libraries like pandas, plotly, etc.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    gcc \

    python3-dev && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*


# 3. Set the working directory inside the container to /app

RUN pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# 6. Install Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 7. Expose port 8501 so Docker knows your app runs on this port (Streamlit default)
EXPOSE 8501

# 8. Set the default command to run your Streamlit app when the container starts
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "Streamlit_Bank_Deployment.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
